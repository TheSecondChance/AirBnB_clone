HTML/CSS
Open web technologies (such as HTML and CSS) have three most peculiar particularities compared to other technologies:

Because anyone is meant to be allowed to code an interpreter for those languages (that what browsers are!)
people making decisions on those technologies are part of an open consortium of companies (called the W3C)
which operates on consensus; therefore they evolve rather slowly.
Reverse compatibility is among the most important values kept in mind when deciding on evolutions
because newest browsers should keep being able to run older websites
and older browsers should be able to access newest websites.
They were not initially designed to make applications or well-designed pages
but just display research documents; while they have come a long way since then
it is visible in the ways things are done.
For each of those three reasons, it is quite important
in order to understand what those technologies are made of today
to understand where they come from, and the legacy that comes with them.
